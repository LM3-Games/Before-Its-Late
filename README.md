BEFORE IT'S LATE

Outsmart the guards, dodge the cameras, catch the train. 

The station is crawling with guards and CCTV cameras, and the clock is ticking. As a thief, you have just one goal: grab enough loot and make it to the departing train before time runs out.

Top-down stealth gameplay – sneak past patrols and avoid detection.

Loot fast, plan faster – every second counts before the train departs.

Dynamic vision cones – stay out of sight or risk being caught.

One mistake and it’s game over – guards won’t hesitate to stop you.

Can you make it out before it’s too late?
